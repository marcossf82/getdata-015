This repo contains all files for the course project.

The data set used is http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

The file run_analysis.R contains the R script used to read the source data and generate the output data.

The file tidyMeans.txt contains the data generated by analysis.

To run the analysis the function "run_analysis" on the script "run_analysis.R" should be excecuted. That function returns a tidy data set.
